# Traveler

The back-end of a full-stack application with the concept of a travel guide site, where you can create a personal account and explore some of the world's most famous destinations. You can see information about each one and also interact with them by marking as a favorite, booking a trip, earning an achievement when you’ve visited a destination, and rating the destination.
